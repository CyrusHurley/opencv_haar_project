# OpenCV Haar Cascade Face Detection Project

This project demonstrates face detection using OpenCV's Haar cascade classifier. It supports both real-time webcam logging and static image analysis, with the ability to log detections and save face snapshots.

## üöÄ Features

- Face detection using Haar cascades
- Real-time webcam analysis with green bounding boxes
- Snapshot saving to local folder with timestamps
- Static image detection mode with basic AI-style decision logic
- Compatible with both **Windows** and **Linux (Ubuntu)** environments
